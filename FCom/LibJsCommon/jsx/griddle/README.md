Griddle is a simple grid Component for use with React. It depends on [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) and [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/) (as well as [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/)). Please check out the [documentation and examples](http://dynamictyped.github.io/Griddle).



To try it out, run the following commands: 

1. `npm install -g grunt-cli` if you don't have grunt.
2. `npm install`
3. `webpack`
4. `grunt`
5. That's it!
